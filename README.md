# Real_Time_Uniform_Detection_System
The Real-Time Dress Code Detection System is a machine learning project designed to identify our college uniform from images or video streams. Built using a customized CNN model, the system processes data in real time and provides accurate results through an interactive user interface. It is scalable and can be customized to detect uniforms for other institutions or workplaces.

# Key Features
Custom CNN Model: Designed specifically for dress code classification.
Real-Time Video Processing: Uses OpenCV for seamless analysis of live video feeds.
Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy image uploads and real-time feedback.
Scalable Design: Supports customization to detect multiple dress codes.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
PyTorch: For building and training the CNN model
OpenCV: For processing video frames
Streamlit: For creating the user interface
NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing

# How It Works
Data Collection: Images of uniforms and non-uniforms are collected and labeled.
Model Training: The custom CNN is trained using PyTorch to classify images.
Real-Time Inference: The model processes live video feeds using OpenCV to detect uniforms in real-time.
Deployment: The system is deployed via a Streamlit web application, enabling users to upload images or use live video for detection.

# Applications
Educational Institutions: Monitor and enforce uniform policies among students and staff.
Corporate Environments: Ensure dress code compliance in workplaces.
Event Management: Verify uniformity in team appearances during events.
# Future Enhancements
Incorporate advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet for improved accuracy.
Add support for detecting multiple uniforms in a single image.
Deploy on cloud platforms for wider accessibility and scalability.
